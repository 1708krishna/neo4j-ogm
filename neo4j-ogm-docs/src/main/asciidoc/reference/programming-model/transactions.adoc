= Transactions

Neo4j is a transactional database, only allowing operations to be performed within transaction boundaries.
Auto commit transactions are provided implicitly for `Session` methods such as `save`, `load`, `delete`, `execute` and so on.

Transactions can also be managed explicitly by calling the `beginTransaction()` method on the `Session` followed by a `commit()` or `rollback()` as required.
