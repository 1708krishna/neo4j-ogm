 * Manages identifiers used within the scope of a single Cypher query.

 * 1. References to new nodes are identified by a monotonically increasing integer 0, 1, 2...
 * prepended by an underscore, e.g.
 *
 * _0, _1, _2 ...
 *
 * 2. References to existing nodes are identified using the node id prepended by a $, e.g
 *
 * $513400, $9075, $2 ...
 *
 * The use of two separate schemes ensures that the identifiers for new nodes and existing nodes cannot
 * overlap.
