2.0.0
--------------
o Initial support for the Bolt Driver and Neo4j 3.0 M5
o Fixes around configuration being autocloseable, TransactionManager issues,
o ConnectionException thrown instead of ResultProcessingException when a connection could not be obtained to Neo4j

2.0.0-M4
--------------
o Fixes issue where an updating an entity with a null property did not remove the property and the original value was retained
o Fixes issue where a char[] and boxed primitive array (embedded driver only) properties on a node could not be mapped to the entity

2.0.0-M3
--------------
o Fixes issue where an array property of an entity would not be saved to the graph correctly if the contents of the array were modified.
o Provides support for handling non-standard resource protocols like 'vfs:'
o Improvements and bug fixes to http connection handling and connection pooling
o The reason for a Cypher statement or query failing is made available and is consistent across drivers. org.neo4j.ogm.exception.CypherException contains the error code and message.
o Drivers extracted into separate modules and dependencies
o Fixes issue where incoming relationships not navigable in the other direction could not be deleted
o Each driver moved to a separate module
o Fixes issue where a user managed transaction would be committed when saving an entity that required multiple Cypher requests
o Fixes issue where an undirected relationship was sometimes not deleted correctly

2.0.0-M2
--------------
o Fixes issue where the number of entities returned in a page is incorrect if related entities of the same type are mapped
o Fixes issue where the result of loading relationship entities with a custom load depth was incorrect. Furthermore, default load depth 1 for a relationship entity will now correctly load it's start and end nodes to depth 1.
o Support for collections of entities of type SortedSet, backed by a TreeSet
o A missing type attribute on a @RelationshipEntity will now result in a compile time error
o Fixes issue where registering an entity type and purging entities from the session were dependent on the equals() implementation of the entity
o Fixes issue where literal maps returned in custom cypher queries could not be parsed
o Fixes issue where saving a collection of entities would save each entity in a separate request and transaction. After this fix, they will be saved in the same transaction, with as few requests as possible

2.0.0-M1
--------------
o Support mapping of custom query results to domain entities
o Upgrade to Neo4j 2.3.2
o Retry http requests in the event of NoHttpResponseException
o Converters using parametrized types now work correctly
o Fixes http-client connection leak when request returns a 300/400/500 response code
o Performance improvements when
  - creating, updating and deleting nodes
  - creating, updating and deleting relationships and relationship entities
o All create, update and delete Cypher queries are cacheable
o Detect use of wildcards on generics and fail with appropriate message
o Support for Neo4j Embedded
o Split into modules for drivers, api, core, compiler and test
